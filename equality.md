Is equality a nice thing? Yes, It may seem unfair if it involves taking something from one and giving to other to make them equals. But what if the resource to be distributed is not taken from but is just to be given. How can we achieve equality or can we ever achieve it?

When we think of equality, we get a picture in mind of people with equal resources who are equally happy. But what makes it unreal is it never happens. There are many levels to it:
* Monetary. Like giving equal money to people.
* Resources. Giving equal resources to people.
* Utility. Proving goods of equal utility(satisfaction) to people.

Now the contradictions among the different levels of equality can be thought of from these cases:

Should monetary equality be preferred to resources or not:

The Govt. of India attempts to achieve equality by providing different monetary rates for minimum wages for the rural and urban workers so that the resource achieved are equal. This can be seen as putting them on par for buying food. But what if equal wages would be better. Why? the saving of money in food may compensate for travel expense to city for medication etc. Also, let the market of human living reach the optimum level of group sizes instead of catering to different sizes.

Equal satisfaction or equal resources:

Some people may derive more utility from same thing. So should they be given same amount or an amount such that they gain equal satisfaction. Put other way, suppose A gets as much satisfaction in reading book as B gets in painting. But Book requires four times more resources to be built than the painting material. So should we spent too much on one personâ€™s want if we can greatly satisfy others with same amount. These difference may arise due to environment or internal factors beyond control. So should we take care of all the difference? If yes, how can we be spending equal resource, time, money on both. Just because a person gets unit satisfaction in small amount of resource does not imply his satisfaction does not rise with more resource. Can we sacrifice so much satisfaction for the sake of equality? If yes, how can we punish someone for differences one has no control over? (Say somebody born rich may derive same utils from more resources as compared to born poor)

There is so much more to this! I would love to hear your views and additions to article as responses. Thank you for reading!
