A hypothesis: draft 1

We live in a complex world. The law is also as complex as us. One thing may be celebrated in one society and may be illegal in another. So what would a perfect law look like. Maybe we can know that once we can check the effect of law free from all other impacts. For achieving such a condition, we must travel to hypothetical place where:
* The countries (rule of law) are not geographic but community driven. So a group of people are part of a country if they agree on each and every rule of country.
* The countries don’t change laws but people travel to territories where each and every law is agreed upon by them.
* There is a territory for every combination of rules. Everything is perfectly mobile. All the material and mental assets can be transferred to any territory without cost.
* There is a umbrella society which provides for effective requirements including law enforcement whatever the law your territory has.
* The territories do not impact each other in any way. No environmental or other consequence of one territory over other.

When such a place is set:
* Every law that survive over time, it is perfect. Any law which is not perfect, people will travel to other territories. If a law does not punish a crime enough, people will travel to place with justifiable laws. Same when the law is extremely strict (say heavy penalty for a little over speeding), people will travel to places of easy laws.
* The places where people flourish have laws which are right. The righteousness of law can not be checked on any eternal or moral standard but the standards felt justified by the people living in the territory.

But the major limitation of this is such a place does not appear or can be thought of developing even in the future.
