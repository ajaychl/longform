what does it take to exist

whatever exists normally has two properties (maybe):
* it is present
* it is perceivable
?? how to explain

if we try to take each characteristic separately:

* present but not percievable. think of a box that is present in front of you but can't be seen, touched. neither does it impact any environmental vairable (space, air pressure or any any thing) nor does it react with anything. ??explain properly?? it is just present but it can't be perceived in anyway. actually, we can't even perceive that it is a box or is present in front of us. we can't even think of it!! but still whatever it is, is present
* perceivable but not present. maybe something a consciousness can think of but it is not present

case I, everything we see around us exists and both conditions are met. but the universe as whole is present but is not perceivable to anything outside it ??have to read more on it?? so, does this universe not exist

case II, ??how do we segregate information perceived?? ??why a perception backed by all is true but by one(thoughts) false?? ??is compounded perception necessary, or does everything we think of thus exist?? we can only know if something exists through perception. 

everything thought/present/perceived exists.
